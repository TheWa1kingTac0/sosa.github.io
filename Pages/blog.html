      Hey everybody! It's nice and breezy out here at Haulover Beach...Fitting
      name for today's event! We are armed and ready with our rubber gloves,
      trash bags, and masks. We're going to give this beach a complete makeover
      (and hopefully see some really cute marine life while doing so)! Check out
      our pics from this morning's haulover on SOSA's socials!
    </p>

      Hey y'all! 2 more days till we give our thanks while stuffing our faces
      with all that turkey! So, here are some of the things we've been thankful
      for in 2020:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You! Without your help and support, we never would've reached our goal
        to complete 6 drone missions, clean over 100 beaches, and save thousands
        of marine lives!
      </li>
      <li>
        T.V. - because let's face it - no one would've gotten through this
        pandemic without Netflix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Masks: without these suffocating bad boys, all of us would've gotten
        COVID by now.
      </li>
      <li>
        And last but not least... Microsoft! Microsoft sponsored 2 of our drone
        missions during these rough times and we are so grateful for them!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Happy Thanksgiving!!!</p>

      upcoming year! We've got great events planned (even a few in January), and
      can't wait to get started. Tune in on New Year's Day for our grand reveal
      of a new event specially for kids! Until then, stay warm, open those

      HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! SOSA is extremely excited to announce
      the launch of an all new overnight weekend camp for kids! Anyone from ages
      13-18 is welcome to come join us at Fort Lauderdale to learn about water
      pollution, how it's affecting us and marine life, and about our drone
      missions. Kids will participate in hands-on team building activities that
      are sure to get the smiling in no time! Registration begins now and is
      open until January 15th or until spots run out. Hurry! There are only 25
      spots due to social distancing regulations. Unfortunately our beach
      haulovers have been rescheduled for March 13th, 27th, and April 1st due to
      COVID-19. Here's to a new year!!
