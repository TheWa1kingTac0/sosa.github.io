      <p style="margin-center: 600px; font-size: 18px;">
        Save Our Sea Animals is a non-profit organization. Our mission
        is to raise awareness about garbage in the oceans and reduce the amount
        of waste and water pollution to the best of our abilities by using
        drones to collect litter, which we then reuse or properly dispose of. We target
        the younger generations, those who will eventually grow up to rule the future.
        We do this to protect marine life and reduce pollution globally, and to give
        everyone a healthier life with cleaner water.

    <h1 style="margin-center">The Problem</h1>
    <h3 style="margin-center">The Great Pacific Garbage Patch</h3>
    <p sytle="margin-center">
      The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a collection of marine debris in the
      North Pacific Ocean. Marine debris is litter that ends up in the ocean,
      seas, and other large bodies of water. It forms around an area of 20
      million square kilometers of water. Most of this is made up of
      microplastics which are tiny pieces of plastic that are not easily visible
      to the naked eye. To learn more about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and
      its effects on the environment, click

    <h3 style="margin-center">Why it Matters</h3>
    <p style="margin-center">
      Garbage patches such as the one discussed above can have many detrimental
      effects on the environment, and can drastically decrease the areas of 
      liveable waters for marine life. Plastic parts in the ocean don't 
      just go away; they break up into mini microplastics that look like a soapy 
      foam from a sattelite's view. These microplastics are dangerous for marine 
      life, as over time, plastic consumption can kill them; other garbage such as 
      plastic rings can get stuck on young marine animals and can deform them as 
      they grow. Garbage islands can also increase the acidity and pollution levels
      in the ocean, which not only harms marine life, but the environment as well.
      Having cleaner bodies of water means living a healthier life - who doesn't want that?

    <h1 style="margin-center">The Solution</h1>
    <div>
      <p style="margin-center" class="text">
        Save Our Sea Animals effectively reduces the amount of waste in the oceans by
        using partially biodegradeable, solar powered drones with four propellers
        that each carry a corner of the net, which then separate to open up the net,
        then rejoin again once they collect the garbage. The drone is made of 3-D printed
        parts that are made from the garbage collected, and is solar powered and waterproof
        with a backup battery, tracking devices, and an emergency flotation device.
        SOSA uses that same garbage to make some of the merchandise that we sell! We 
        have workers that sort out the collected garbage, saving anything that is
        salveagable, and properly disposing of the rest. Even though there may
        be and excessive amount of garbage in the ocean for us alone to clean up, 
        we are sure we can do it with your help! By making sure we spread the word
        about our cause, we can ensure that future generations become aware of
        the problems facing the environment today, and can work towards a solution.
      </p>
      <h3>How it Works</h3>
      <p>
        These drones have many features that help them do their job, such
        as:

        <li>Solar Power</li>
        <li>Tracking devices</li>
        <li>Backup battery</li>
        <li>Waterproof</li>
        <li>Recyclable parts</li>
