        Estimates suggest that <em><strong>1.4 billion pounds</strong></em> of

        <em><strong>each year</strong></em> from plastic pollution. These are

    />

    <p>As a baby turtle, Peanut got caught in a 6-pack ring.
       She couldn't get out, and as she grew, Peanut learned
      to live with the plastic around her waist.
       Due to the deformation, some of her organs failed 
       to develop completely. Thankfully, she was found in
      Missouri and was taken to a zoo in St. Louis. <br><br>While 
      Peanutâ€™s story ended well (relatively speaking), she just
       highlights the effect our excess consumption and waste 
       have wreaked on defenseless animals around the world.<br><br>
